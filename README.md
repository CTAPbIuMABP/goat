GOAT
====
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CTAPbIuMABP/goat.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CTAPbIuMABP/goat)

:)

To make the first build run:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
npm install
bower install

node server
```

Note: bower doesn't actually run `preinstall` and `postinstall` tasks if no one package was updated
